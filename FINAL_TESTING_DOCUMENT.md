## üêõ Bug Report Summary

### Bug #1: Form Submission Interception Issues

**Severity:** Medium  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Identified  
**Description:** Some form submissions are intercepted by browser security features, causing test failures. The automated tests implement multiple fallback methods (JavaScript execution, force clicks) to handle these scenarios.  
**Impact:** May affect user experience if forms don't submit properly on first attempt.  
**Recommendation:** Implement more robust form submission handling in the application code.

### Bug #2: Dynamic Element Loading Timing

**Severity:** Low  
**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** Identified  
**Description:** Some page elements load dynamically, causing timing issues in automated tests. Tests implement explicit waits and retry mechanisms to handle this.  
**Impact:** Minimal impact on user experience, but may cause test flakiness.  
**Recommendation:** Add loading indicators or improve element loading consistency.

### Bug #3: Cross-Browser Compatibility Variations

**Severity:** Low  
**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** Identified  
**Description:** Minor differences in element rendering and behavior across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) require different locator strategies in tests.  
**Impact:** Tests need browser-specific adjustments but functionality works across all browsers.  
**Recommendation:** Standardize CSS classes and element attributes for better cross-browser consistency.

### Overall Bug Assessment

- **Critical Bugs:** 0
- **High Severity:** 0
- **Medium Severity:** 1
- **Low Severity:** 2
- **Total Bugs Identified:** 3

The system demonstrates good overall quality with no critical or high-severity bugs identified during testing.
